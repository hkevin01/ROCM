The error message you're encountering indicates that Git is unable to authenticate with GitHub using your SSH key. Here are steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

### 1. Check if You Have an SSH Key

First, check if you already have an SSH key generated:

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

You should see files named `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` (or similar). If these files do not exist, you'll need to generate a new SSH key.

### 2. Generate a New SSH Key (if necessary)

If you don't have an SSH key, generate one with the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Press Enter to accept the default file location, and then create a passphrase if desired.

### 3. Add Your SSH Key to the SSH Agent

Start the SSH agent in the background:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Then add your SSH key:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

### 4. Add Your SSH Key to GitHub

1. **Copy your SSH key to the clipboard**:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

2. **Log in to GitHub** and navigate to **Settings**.
3. Go to **SSH and GPG keys** and click on **New SSH key**.
4. Paste the copied SSH key into the key field and give it a title.
5. Click **Add SSH key**.

### 5. Test Your SSH Connection

Test if your SSH key is working with GitHub:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see a message like:

```
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

### 6. Retry Your Push

Now, try pushing your changes again:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### Summary

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the permission denied issue and successfully push to your GitHub repository. If you still encounter issues, ensure that the repository URL is correct and that you have access to the repository.
